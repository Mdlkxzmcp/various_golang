Weekend fun with Go



##Some of my after notes:

+ Creating executables for not only the currently used but also other OS's with such an ease is amazing!

+ Very focused, nifty language with a powerful compiler.

+ Running the same program on both 1 thread and all threads was a joy that, in addition, was super easy to implement.

+ Amazing two-way type declaration and pleasant pointers.

+ Structs are a nice twist on classes.

- Working from custom directories is the biggest downside in Go.
