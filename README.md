Weekend fun with Go

Some of my after notes:

-Creating executables for not only the currently used but also other OS's with such an ease is amazing!
-Very focused, nifty language with a powerful compiler.
-Working from custom directories is the biggest downside to Go.
-Running the same program on both 1 thread and all threads was a joy that, in addition, was super easy to implement.
